                            <p>
                                The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America
                                has a place for him, too. Threatening Israel with destruction - or
                                repeating vile stereotypes about Jews - is deeply wrong, and only
                                serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of
                                memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region
                                deserve.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are
                                ultimately more stable, successful and secure. But it should be
                                their choice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's rededicate ourselves to a new kind of politics - a politics
                                of conscience. I would not be running for President if I didn't
                                believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of
                                Americans want for this country. Many bring up a specific issue.

                                <p>
                                    That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are
                                    fed and clothed and safe from harm. It's a journey that takes us
                                    back to our nation's founding, when none other than a UCC church
                                    inspired the Boston Tea Party and helped bring an Empire to its
                                    knees. "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap
                                    and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up
                                    into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard
                                    something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands
                                    of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary
                                    black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath,
                                    Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's
                                    field of dry bones. And nothing will change. These challenges
                                    are not all of government's making. I know there is debate about
                                    this issue.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'd been inspired by the civil rights movement - by all the
                                    clear-eyed, straight-backed, courageous young people who'd
                                    boarded buses and traveled down South to march and sit at lunch
                                    counters, and lay down their lives in some cases for freedom.
                                    And it puts the lie to the notion that the separation of church
                                    and state in America means faith should have no role in public
                                    life. Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still
                                    stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with
                                    these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in
                                    democracy. You understand that in this election, the greatest
                                    risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same
                                    old players and expect a different result.

                                    Religious leaders like my friends Rev. Jim Wallis and Rabbi
                                    David Saperstein and Nathan Diament are working for justice and
                                    fighting for change. Consensus and compromise will not come
                                    easy. And the lack of basic services in so many urban black
                                    neighborhoods - parks for kids to play in, police walking the
                                    beat, regular garbage pick-up and building code enforcement -
                                    all helped create a cycle of violence, blight and neglect that
                                    continue to haunt us. But it is where we start. That's the
                                    change we need right now.
                                </p>

                                    God is still speaking. We may not agree on abortion, but surely
                                    we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in
                                    this country. A belief that there are better days ahead. And
                                    because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost
                                    her health care.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But somehow, somewhere along the way, faith stopped being used
                                    to bring us together and started being used to drive us apart.

                            <p>
                                At every opportunity, they've told evangelical Christians that
                                Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while
                                suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care
                                only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and
                                intelligent design. In the end, then, what is called for is nothing
                                more, and nothing less, than what all the world's great religions
                                demand - that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
                                The issues that I have described will not be easy to address.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and
                                Methodists, was one of the most spiritual souls I ever knew. In my
                                first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my
                                first service at Trinity: That is true genius of this nation. And
                                then another one.

                                If you're working forty hours a week, you shouldn't be living in
                                poverty. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy
                                talk. We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we
                                have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has
                                been written.
